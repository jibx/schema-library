<!-- USE CASE SCENARIO: OPENTRAVEL FORUM POST -->
<!-- USE CASE DETAILS:
I am looking for an example of an OTA_HotelAvailRQ/RS with this criteria:

1) Arrival & Departure Dates: (Arrival) 30/08/2010 AUG 30 2010; (Departure) 02/09/2010 SEP 2 2010; total of a 4 night stay)
2) Two individual rooms (The first with 2 adults and the second with 3 adults)

I’d like an example of the following returned availability information in the response message:
1) First room type is "double room"
2) Second room type is "triple room"
3) Each room type has three rate plans:
3.1) first: "High season rate plan" from 30 to 31 August
3.2) second: "Low season rate plan" from 1 to 2 September
3.3) three:"1 night gratis for every two" 

The room prices are in Euro’s for the request and response:
Day: 1 2 3 4
Room type
Double 80 0 60 0
Triple 95 0 75 0

I am not interested in location, hotel information and other information that may be in the message – I’m only interested in the <RoomStays> element within the message.

Can you write an xml example for this situation?
