<!-- USE CASE SCENARIO: Cancel One or More "Provisionally Booked" Train Seat Reservations. -->
<!-- USE CASE DETAILS: An online travel agent is booking a rail trip for a family of five. The agent has provisionally booked five seats on a train using the OTA_RailBookRQ/RS message. Note that a provisional booking is one that has been processed successfully by the OTA_RailBookRQ/RS messages but is not yet confirmed in the trading partners system. Two of the provisionally booked seats now need to be cancelled as two family members will not be going on the trip. The agent system has requested a CANCEL for the two booked seats using the OTA_RailIgnoreBookingRQ message. This response message indicates that the CANCEL of the two seats has been successful and the unique ID's of the cancelled seat reservations are returned. Note that an OTA_RailConfirmBookingRQ message must be used to do a final COMMIT on the three remaining seat reservations. -->
