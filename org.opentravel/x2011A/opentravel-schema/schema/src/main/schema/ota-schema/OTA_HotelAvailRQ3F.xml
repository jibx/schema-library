Because many of the types include partial matches to string values such as partial addresses (street names without a number) or partial telephone numbers (area code or three-digit prefix area, etc.) a ExactMatch attribute indicates whether the match to the string value must be exact. -->

					<!-- AlternateAvailability (OPTIONAL) - Most hotel supplier CRS systems will return alternate availability and this value identifies under what circumstances alternate availability should be returned. Make sure you check with your trading partner to see if they support alternate availability. "Never" = Do not return alternate availability. "WhenUnavailable" = Only return alternates when requested is not available. "Always" = Always return alternates even when request is available. -->
					
					<!-- Use any parts of the address information to refine your search, such as street name, postal code, or country code. I used the city of "Tampa" and state of "Florida" for this example. You can also search for a city for example by <Position> using the latitude and longitude coordinates (expressed in notation specified by ISO standard 6709) - I didn't include that in this example as it's not well suited for a city search. -->
