<!-- USE CASE SCENARIO: #1: Airport Transfer -->
<!-- USE CASE DETAILS: 

1.	Jane Smith needs ground transportation to an airport and goes to the Academy Limousine site because they have sent her a 10% off coupon for an airport transfer.
2.	From the Academy Limousine website, Jane does an availability request for June 15 at 9:00 AM. (OTA_GroundAvailRQ_AirportTransfer.xml)
3.	Jane receives two ground transportation availability responses, one for an Executive Sedan and one for a Luxury Sedan. She reviews the pricing, fees, deposit and cancellation information for each service. (OTA_GroundAvailRS_AirportTransfer.xml)
4.	Jane selects the Executive Sedan and books the ground transportation service. (OTA_GroundBookRQ_AirportTransfer.xml)
5.	She receives a booking response that includes the details of her ground transportation reservation. (THIS INSTANCE)
6.	A week after making the ground transportation reservation, Jane has had to change her flight to be two hours later (11:00 AM). She phones Academy Limousine to change her reservation, but does not know her reservation number.
7.	The Academy Limousine representative searches for Jane’s reservation by entering her last name and date of service (OTA_GroundResRetrieveRQ_AirportTransferQuery.xml). She receives 2 responses and identifies Jane’s reservation (OTA_GroundResRetrieveRS_AirportTransferQuery.xml)
8. The Academy Limousine representative then issues a reservation retrieve request using the confirmation number returned in step 7 above and receives a detailed reservation response (OTA_GroundResRetrieveRQ_AirportTransferDetail.xml/ OTA_GroundResRetrieveRS_AirportTransferDetail.xml)
