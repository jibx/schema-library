<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!-- OPENTRAVEL SAMPLE INSTANCE --><!-- USE CASE SCENARIO: Rail Schedule Request for Direct Trains within a 2 Hour Departure Time. --><!-- USE CASE DETAILS: An end user uses a wholesaler website to find a direct (no connection) train for a business trip between Beijing and Shanghai. They are flexible in their travel time and specify that a 2 hour time period before and after a 10:00 AM departure time is acceptable. Additionally, both Beijing and Shanghai have multiple train stations within the city and the end user has indicated that any station within either city is acceptable for both departure and arrival. The wholesaler system uses this message to request train schedules that meet the specified criteria. --><OTA_RailScheduleRQ TimeStamp="2011-02-03T10:25:30" EchoToken="7656" Target="Production" Version="1.000" PrimaryLangID="CHI" MaxResponses="100" xmlns="http://www.opentravel.org/OTA/2003/05" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opentravel.org/OTA/2003/05OTA_RailScheduleRQ.xsd">	<!-- Transaction originator (point of sale) information. -->	<POS>		<Source>			<RequestorID Type="7" ID="JQIR2244" MessagePassword="ek^4$327F21"/>				<!-- RequestorID Type 7: Wholesaler (See OpenTravel Code List Unique ID Type.) -->				<!-- Password specified for authentication with trading partner system. -->		</Source>	</POS>	<!--The search criteria for a rail schedule search request. -->	<RailScheduleQuery MaxConnections="0">		<!-- MaxConnections of "0" indicates direct train preferred -->				<!-- Information on the locations between which schedules and/or availability are to be checked. -->		<OriginDestinationInformation>			<DepartureDateTime WindowBefore="PT2H" WindowAfter="PT2H">2011-02-06T10:00:00</DepartureDateTime>				<!-- Sunday departure at approximately 10:00 AM (with a 2 hour window before and after 10:00 AM)-->			<OriginLocation MultiCityStationInd="true" LocationCode="PEK">BEIJING</OriginLocation>				<!-- MultiCityStationInd of true means any train station within Beijing is acceptable-->			<DestinationLocation MultiCityStationInd="true" LocationCode="SHA">SHANGHAI</DestinationLocation>				<!-- MultiCityStationInd of true means any train station within Shanghai is acceptable-->		</OriginDestinationInformation>			</RailScheduleQuery>	</OTA_RailScheduleRQ>
