<!-- USE CASE SCENARIO: #1: Local golf course with carts and club rentals -->
<!-- USE CASE DETAILS: 

Jane and John Smith are golfers and are looking for a local course to play on. They are flexible in the days and times that they can play, but they want a course that provides golf carts and has club rentals. They do a search through an online golf site (Golf For All) and see that The Grand Del Mar is a local course that has golf carts and club rentalsâ€”and an afternoon tee time discount, so they book the discounted afternoon tee time.
