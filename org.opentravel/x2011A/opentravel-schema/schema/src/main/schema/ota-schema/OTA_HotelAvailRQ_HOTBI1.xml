<!-- USE CASE SCENARIO: Send Hotel Stay Billing Instructions for Corporate Hotel Stay to a Property Management (or other) System Using the OTA_HotelResNotifRQ/RS Message. -->
<!-- USE CASE STEP: (1 OF 3): THIS USE CASE INSTANCE IS FOR THE FIRST STEP OF THE SCENARIO WHERE HOTEL AVAILABILITY IS QUERIED. -->
<!-- USE CASE DETAILS: Jane Martin is representing her company, Widgets-R-Us, at a tradeshow event at the Hotel Deluxe in Phoenix from June 1 through June 3. Widgets-R-Us is paying for Jane’s room rate, room taxes and meals for the 3 days of her stay per a negotiated agreement between Hotel Deluxe and the Widgets-R-Us. Jane uses an online travel site to check availability at the Hotel Deluxe, and upon finding availability books her stay using her corporate credit card as a payment guarantee. On June 3, the last day of Jane’s stay, a billing instruction code (RMTXFD) is sent to the Hotel Deluxe property management system (PMS) that instructs Jane’s room rate, room taxes and meals for the 3 days of her stay (June 1 through June 3) to be billed to Widgets-R-Us. -->
