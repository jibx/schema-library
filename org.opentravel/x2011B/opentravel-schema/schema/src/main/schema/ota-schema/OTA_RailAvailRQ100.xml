<!-- USE CASE SCENARIO: Rail Availability Request with an Arrival Time Preference. -->
<!-- USE CASE DETAILS: An end user uses a wholesaler website to find availability for a direct (no connection) train for a business trip between Beijing and Shanghai. They have a meeting at 10:00 AM so they specify a preferred arrival time. Additionally, both Beijing and Shanghai have multiple train stations within the city and the end user has indicated that any station within either city is acceptable for both departure and arrival. The wholesaler system uses this message to request train availability that meet the specified criteria. -->
