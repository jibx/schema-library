<!-- USE CASE SCENARIO: Confirm One or More "Provisionally Booked" Train Seat Reservations. -->
<!-- USE CASE DETAILS: An online travel agent is booking a rail trip for a family of five. The agent has provisionally booked five seats on a train using the OTA_RailBookRQ/RS message. Note that a provisional booking is one that has been processed successfully by the OTA_RailBookRQ/RS messages but is not yet confirmed in the trading partners system. The agent system has issued an OTA_RailConfirmBookingRQ message with the unique ID's of the five provisional train seat reservations. This response message indicates that the COMMIT of the five seat reservations has been successful and the unique ID's of the committed seat reservations are returned. -->
